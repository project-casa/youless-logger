A _YouLess energy monitor_ is a handy device to monitor your power and gas usage. It has its downsides though, one is a
limited amount of historical data that is stored. This package aims to solve that problem by storing the monitored data
of each interval for a much longer period of time. And it is able to do so for multiple YouLess devices. 
It also provides an API compatible with YouLess' own API so the service can easily be used by any existing client.

Key features are:

- no more limits on monitored data
- get data from multiple devices
- only monitor the utility services you want
- configure update intervals
- classic api can serve older data
- support for grpc and graphql

## API server for use with Logger

## Observer server

## CLI tool
A CLI tool is available to display info or communicate with the configured devices. Login to the Docker container and
use `yl list` to list all available commands. It is also possible to run the tool outside of the Docker container
via `docker exec -it {container_name} yl {command}`.

## Client package

-----

## Installation

```docker pull roeldev/casa-youless-logger```

### Docker-compose

```
services:
  youless-logger-service:
    image: roeldev/casa-youless-logger:latest
    volumes:
      - config:/youless-logger/config/
      - data:/youless-logger/data/
      - log:/youless-logger/log/
```

### Volumes

| Path                         | Contains                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| ```/youless-logger/config``` | Config files            
| ```/youless-logger/data```   | Database (backup) files 
| ```/youless-logger/log```    | Log files               

## Configuration

Support for multiple YouLess devices means a little more configuration. Altough it should be pretty self explanatory,
most important stuff is mentioned in this chapter. But first, have a look at the
_[sample config](youless-logger/config/config-example.php)_ for a quick overview of possibilities.

Each device should have at least an _ip_ option set so the logger can reach the device's API. All other values are not
required. However, this probably results in way too much useless data being saved. Therefore it's recommended to only
enable the data service(s) that are actually monitored. and disables classic API support
> **Note:** Latest YouLess devices support data from multiple different counters: power, gas, s0 and water. 
> Older versions only support power.

Below example adds two devices:

1. _house_ which requires a password to access the API on _192.168.1.27_ and provides data of power and gas consumption;
2. _shed_ which is hosted on _192.168.1.32_ and only provides data of the s0 pulse counter.

```
'devices' => [
    'house' => [
        'ip' => 'http://192.168.1.27',
        'password' => 'secret',
        'services' => [
            'power' => true,
            'gas' => true,
            's0' => false,
        ]
    ],
    'shed' => [
        'ip' => 'http://192.168.1.32'
        'services' => [ 's0' ]
    ]
]
```

## Stored data

A new SQLite database is created on first run. All data values are stored in the `data` table within this database.

### Intervals

| Id | Interval | API equiv. | LS110 history*  | LS120 history*   | Unit (power/s0) | Unit (gas)       |
|----|----------|------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1  | minute   | h          | 1 hour (2x30)   | 10 hours (20x30) | watt            | n/a              
| 2  | 10 mins  | w          | 24 hours (3x48) | 10 days (30x48)  | watt            | liter            
| 3  | hour     | d          | 7 days (7x24)   | 70 days (70x24)  | watt            | liter            
| 4  | day      | m          | 1 year (12x31)  | 1 year (12x31)   | kWh             | m3 (cubic meter) 

* = max. history (amount of pages x data entries)

### Units

| Id | Unit  | API equiv. | Service  |
|----|-------|------------|----------|
| 1  | watt  | Watt       | power/s0 
| 2  | kwh   | kWh        | power/s0 
| 3  | liter | l          | gas      
| 4  | m3    | m3         | gas
